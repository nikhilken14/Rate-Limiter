# Student Rate-Limited API with Cache

This project is a **Spring Boot** application that demonstrates a REST API for fetching student records. It integrates the following key components:

- ✅ In-memory caching (using **Caffeine**)  
- ✅ Token Bucket **Rate Limiter**  
- ✅ Spring Data JPA with **H2 in-memory DB**  
- ✅ REST Controller that combines cache-first logic with rate limiting

---

## 📌 Overview

The API flow works like this:

1. **Controller receives request**
2. **Cache is checked first**
   - If found → return response
   - If not → check the rate limiter
3. If request is allowed:
   - Fetch data from DB
   - Store in cache
   - Return response
4. If too many requests → return HTTP `429 Too Many Requests`
5. Cached data expires in **5 minutes**

## 📦 API Example
GET /api/1

✅ 200 OK with student data

❌ 429 Too Many Requests (if over the limit)
